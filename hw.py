"""
Given a list [6, 8, 9, 2, 4, 1, -3, 0]
replace every number by the maximum number on its right,
for the last number replace it with -1
[9, 9, 4, 4, 0, 0, -1]
Req:
    1. Your program should be general for all lists
        edge cases like [] --> [], [1] --> [-1]
    2. it should work as expected
    3. do the time complexity analysis
